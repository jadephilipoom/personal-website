## Work Interests

I'm a PhD student in MIT's Programming Languages and Verification group
([PLV](plv.csail.mit.edu)). I'm currently in the exploratory phase of working on
lattice-based crypto in the proof assistant Coq. I'm also continuing my
longstanding work with [fiat-crypto](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto),
another Coq project which generates verified code for ECC primitives. Both of
these projects amount to using the proof assistant to guatantee that certain
cryptography code actually implements its algorithmic specification.

My general areas of interest include distributed systems and computer security,
particularly in relation to verification. I'm also interested in how to
effectively introduce people to programming, both generally and for specialized
contexts like verification.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We introduce a new approach for implementing cryptographic arithmetic in short high-level code with machine-checked proofs of functional correctness.
We further demonstrate that simple partial evaluation is sufficient to transform into the fastest-known C code, breaking the decades-old pattern that the only fast implementations are those whose instruction-level steps were written out by hand.<p>
These techniques were used to build an elliptic-curve library that achieves competitive performance for 80 prime fields and multiple CPU architectures, showing that implementation and proof effort scales with the number and complexity of conceptually different algorithms, not their use cases.
As one outcome, we present the first verified high-performance implementation of P-256, the most widely used elliptic curve.
Implementations from our library were included in BoringSSL to replace existing specialized code, for inclusion in several large deployments for Chrome, Android, and CloudFlare.
