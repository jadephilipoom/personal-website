            <font size="-1">
              We introduce a new approach for implementing cryptographic
              arithmetic in short high-level code with machine-checked proofs of
              functional correctness. We further demonstrate that simple partial
              evaluation is sufficient to transform into the fastest-known C
              code, breaking the decades-old pattern that the only fast
              implementations are those whose instruction-level steps were
              written out by hand.
              <p>
                These techniques were used to build an elliptic-curve library
                that achieves competitive performance for 80 prime fields and
                multiple CPU architectures, showing that implementation and
                proof effort scales with the number and complexity of
                conceptually different algorithms, not their use cases. As one
                outcome, we present the first verified high-performance
                implementation of P-256, the most widely used elliptic curve.
                Implementations from our library were included in BoringSSL to
                replace existing specialized code, for inclusion in several
                large deployments for Chrome, Android, and CloudFlare.
